### PURPOSE:
### This script makes a backup of some folders from your local desktop computer,
### towards a remote machine. By default, this script only copies new files
### and files that were modified, using the program rsync.
### If you deleted files on your local computer, they are NOT deleted on the remote machine.
### Note that this script *DOES NOT SYNCHRONIZE* your local computer with the remote machine,
### because it does not copy anything from the remote machine to your computer. It only
### copies files from your computer towards the remote one.
### In other words, this script "backups" your files to the remote machine.

### REQUIREMENTS:
### (1) you must have an account on the remote machine
###     (see REMOTEADMIN to know who to contact to create your account)
### (2) the remote machine must be accessible via the network
###     (change "remote" below into the address of the target remote machine)

### USAGE:
### On first run, it is recommended to run this script with:
###   bash backup.sh --install
### Otherwise you may just run it simply with:
###   bash backup.sh
### If you wish to run in verbose mode:
###   bash backup.sh --verbose

### Name of current script
name="${0##*/}"

### List of folders from your home directory (/home/user/) to backup
### Add or remove the desired folders from this list
folders="Documents"

### Name of remote machine or NAS
remote="address-of-remote-machine"

### Port for ssh access on remote machine
port=22

### Set name of administrator of the remote machine
REMOTEADMIN="Name (email@address)"

### Set parameters of rsync command (see rsync's manual for more info)
### a = archive mode (includes recursion into sub-folders)
### u = update files only
### k = copy links to directories
### z = compress files during transfer (saves network bandwidth)
arg="-aukz"
if [ "$1" = "--verbose" ] ; then
  ### Run in verbose mode
  arg="-aukvz"
fi

### If the port for ssh access is not the default (22), say it to rsync
if [ "${port}" != "22" ] ; then
  arg+=" -e 'ssh -p ${port}'"
fi

### If you deleted files on your desktop computer, and want to remove
### them on the remote machine, then uncomment the following line:
#arg+=" --delete-after"

### Username on local computer (automatic detection)
u=$(whoami)
### Username on remote machine
### (modify if your remote login is different from your desktop computer)
v=$u

### If user runs this script with argument "--install", then:
### (1) copy current script to his/her directory ~/bin/
### (2) add cron job to his/her crontab
### (3) create RSA key for ssh login without password
if [ "$1" = "--install" ] ; then
